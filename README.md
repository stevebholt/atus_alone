Do files clean ATUS multi-year files and create figures for time spent alone and with friends split by a variety of observable characteristics. 

Multi-year files can be downloaded here: https://www.bls.gov/tus/data/datafiles-0322.htm

Code needs to be updated for years beyond 2021. 

To run, 1. download the .dat files to the raw data subfolder in the project drive, 2. change the path in the cd lines at the top and bottom of the do files to the path where the raw data has been downloaded and stored, and 3. run the do files.
